## 1. Why should I do this?
Stealing an excerpt from [https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications](https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications)...

_The demand for Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢ and NoSQL skills is skyrocketing, with Cassandra developers commanding **31% higher salaries**, the highest of any database technology._

_**An Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢ Administrator Associate Certification** or **Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢ Developer Associate Certification** is the best way to get started learning and mastering the popular NoSQL database used by teams at Apple, Netflix, Sony, Uber, and thousands more._

_An official certification helps you gain confidence in your knowledge of Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢ and increases opportunities for career advancement._

## 2. Which certification?
Again, stealing from [https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications](https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications)...

_The Developer Certification is designed for professionals that use Apache Cassandra clusters to manage data. This includes roles such as application developers, data architects, database designers, and database administrators._

_The Administrator Certification is designed for professionals who install, configure, manage and tune the performance of Apache Cassandra clusters, such as database administrators, DevOps engineers and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)._

You can choose one path or do them both, it's up to you. Either way you'll level up your game and give yourself an edge up in your career.
